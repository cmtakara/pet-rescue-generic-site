## Installation

This is a frontend created using React.  It is deployed using Heroku and can be found at [Generic Pet rescue](https://pet-rescue-app.herokuapp.com/).

There is an associated backend (the part that handles the database and models) that developed in Java using PostgreSql, and it can be found at:

github:

This is a web application, so there is no installation process.  You simply need to use the urls provided to access the specified endpoints.
to enter the site.  This site currently works with the deployed frontend.  The backend is the part that handles the database interactions, via the API.


## Usage

The intended user for this is rescue organizations.  While there are a large amount of website templates available, they don't necessarily meet the needs of the rescue where you want to show the public all of the available animals and gain their interest, but also want to keep all of the information regarding the animals and the people involved in the organization.

This current version is extremely generic, as the purpose is to be flexible so that small rescue organizations can easily modify it to their own needs.

There is a login page so that only authorized users (owner, volunteer) can access certain aspects.  The goal of the page is to be flexible and easily modified 
so that small groups can easily create a website that fits their needs.  There are some unique needs that rescues have that aren't met with generic websites.  


## Future updates

Update the frontend to accomodate the endpoints in the backend
Add the ability to filter the different list based on characteristics
Have volunteer inputs
