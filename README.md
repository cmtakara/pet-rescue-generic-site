# Pet Rescue Template

This is a website created using React.  It is deployed using Heroku and can be found at [Generic Pet rescue](https://pet-rescue-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation

This is a web application, so there is no installation process.  You simply need to use the url provided to enter the site.

## Usage

This current version is extremely generic, as the purpose is to be flexible so that small rescue organizations can easily modify it to their own needs.
There is a login page so that only authorized users (owner, volunteer) can access certain aspects.  The goal of the page is to be flexible and easily modified 
so that small groups can easily create a website that fits their needs.  There are some unique needs that rescues have that aren't met with generic websites.
